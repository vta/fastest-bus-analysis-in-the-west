## Code to develop data for Speed and Reliability Analysis

This program pulls data from different sources like Swiftly and ridership and other sources for bus and light rail routes, to better quantify and visualize ridership and speed information.

Many of the resources and data are internal to the VTA.  Access is via a config file not found in the repo.
